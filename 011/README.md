# Project Euler: Problem 11 - Largest product in a grid

Problem's URL: https://projecteuler.net/problem=11

Not a primes problem! Yaaay!

## Haskell

Haskell version is not as elegant and straightforward as I expected.
Calculating diagonal products is too imperative in my opinion. But I can't
come up with anything more clever at the moment.

## C++

Implemented as four simple loops, checking 4-number products horizontally,
vertically, and diagonally.
